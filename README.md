This section also includes a highlight from your journal entry from the previous day (assuming there is one).

### Daily Mood Tracker
This space allows you to check in with your current mood and energy level to make you more mindful of where you're at, and what you would like to get out of the journaling experience.

### An Inspirational Pop-Up
Once you have completed the journal entry, you'll be sent off with a famous quote and a challenge for the day - hope it inspires you!
