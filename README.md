# Five-Minute Journal

## Description
This website is a group project for Module 01 of the Columbia Engineering Coding Bootcamp. It is the culmination of six weeks of work, where we explored programs such as HTML, CSS, & Javascript to create aesthetic and dynamic webpages.

### What is a Five-Minute Journal?
A Five-Minute Journal is a simple, structured journaling method designed to help individuals cultivate gratitude, mindfulness, and positivity in just a few minutes each day. It typically involves a daily practice of writing down things you are grateful for, setting intentions for the day, and reflecting on positive experiences.

In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, many people struggle with stress, anxiety, and a lack of focus. The Five-Minute Journal allows users of our web application to addresses these issues wherever they are in the world. By providing a quick and effective way to foster a positive mindset and improve mental well-being, it helps individuals break free from negative thought patterns and encourages a more optimistic outlook on life.

### What are the Benefits You Can Expect?
It is time efficient - requiring only a few minutes each day, making it easy to integrate into any routine and generate a daily habit.

It creates a positive mindset - fostering a more optimistic outlook in a fun achievable way.

It provides personal growth - allowing self-awareness and goal-setting, leading to personal development.
